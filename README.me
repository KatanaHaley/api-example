## Simple API

First, install the dependencies:

yarn install

Next, run the development server:

yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) with your browser to see the result.

The server is located in index.ts. The `src/controllers/reference` file is mapped to `/references`. A reference will be created when 
you make a POST request to `/references`.
